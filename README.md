<h1>Random Number guessing Game</h1>

<p align=left>Hello everyone this is my first python game & project.I have developed it as a random number guessing game from 1 to 50.You can very well access the code and enjoy playing it in your system :) </p>

<h2>Game Rules</h2>

<ul>
	<li>You have to give your name in the prompt</li>
	<li>You have 6 chances to guess the number</li>
	<li>If your number is too far away(more than 10(+ or -)) the prompt will say a too high or low hint </li>
	<li>If your number is within the limit 10 , you will get a high or low hint</li>
	<li>If your number is within the limit of 5 , you will get a very close hint</li>
	<li>Guess the number within 6 number of tries :) </li>
</ul>
